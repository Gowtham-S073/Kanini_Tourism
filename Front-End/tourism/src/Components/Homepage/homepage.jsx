          <Typography>
            No, there is no fee for our vacation planning services as the travel vendors involved recognize our value and compensate us from the gross amount paid (what you would have paid even without our assistance). For those complicated international itineraries that require custom crafting and significant involvement of our international on-location partners, we do request an intent-to-travel deposit to begin the process. This deposit is applied to the reservations that are made on your behalf.
